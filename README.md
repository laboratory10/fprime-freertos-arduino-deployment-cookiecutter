## Welcome to the fprime-freertos-arduino-deployment-cookiecutter!

The name might be a bit of a mouthful, but itâ€™s fully descriptive of what this repository offers. ***This repository contains an F' deployment cookiecutter designed for use with Arduino systems running the FreeRTOS real-time operating system.***

The <a href="https://fprime.jpl.nasa.gov/">F' Flight Software Framework</a> is an embedded systems framework that is designed to expidite and simplify development. A F' project can consist of multiple deployments, which are individual builds of code typically tied to a specific device or hardware configuration. This repository is a cookiecutter (or template) that can be linked from within a F' project's `settings.ini` file or passed in as a command line argument. If used, F' will use these files to setup a new deployment.

The <a href="https://fprime.jpl.nasa.gov/">F' Flight Software Framework</a> is an embedded systems framework created to expedite and simplify development. An F' project can include multiple deployments, each representing a specific build of code tied to a particular device or hardware configuration. This repository serves as a cookiecutter (template) that can be referenced in an F' project's settings.ini file or passed as a command-line argument when setting up a new deployment.

While the F' Framework provides a wide range of features, it is intentionally not a Real-Time Operating System (RTOS). To run an F' application, you need an OS to connect to the F' Operating System Abstraction Layer or use the simplified <a href="https://github.com/fprime-community/fprime-baremetal">fprime-baremetal</a> implementation. This cookiecutter is designed to be used with the <a href="https://github.com/laboratory10/fprime-freertos">fprime-freertos</a> implementation, which bridges the F' Operating System Abstraction Layer with <a href="https://www.freertos.org/">FreeRTOS</a>, an open-source RTOS for microcontrollers and small microprocessors.

Additionally, this deployment cookiecutter is structured to work well with the <a href="https://github.com/fprime-community/fprime-arduino">fprime-arduino</a> repository on compatible Arduino devices. However, it may not work on all devices, as many Arduino platforms supported by fprime-arduino lack sufficient memory to handle an fprime-freertos application. Since this cookiecutter was designed to be used with Arduino deployments, it is based off of the <a href="https://github.com/fprime-community/fprime-arduino-deployment-cookiecutter">fprime-arduino-deployment-cookiecutter</a>.
