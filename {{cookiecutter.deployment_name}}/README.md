# {{cookiecutter.deployment_name}} Application

This deployment was auto-generated by the F' utility tool.

## Building and Running the {{cookiecutter.deployment_name}} Application

In order to build the {{cookiecutter.deployment_name}} application, or any other FÂ´ application, we first need to generate a build directory. This can be done with the following commands:

```
fprime-util generate
```

The next step is to build the {{cookiecutter.deployment_name}} application's code.
```
fprime-util build
```

## Running the application and F' GDS

The following command will spin up the F' GDS as well as run the application binary and the components necessary for the GDS and application to communicate.

```
fprime-gds -n --dictionary ./build-artifacts/<build name>/{{cookiecutter.deployment_name}}/dict/{{cookiecutter.deployment_name}}AppDictionary.xml --communication-selection uart --uart-device /dev/ttyACM0 --uart-baud 115200
```

> Change `<build name>` to the build of your deployment (i.e. `teensy41`, `featherM0`, etc.).

> `/dev/ttyACM0` may vary for your system/device. It may also be `/dev/ttyUSB0`. For MacOS, it will be along the lines of `/dev/tty.usbmodem12345`. Change accordingly.
> To view the list of your connected devices, run: `ls /dev/tty*`.
